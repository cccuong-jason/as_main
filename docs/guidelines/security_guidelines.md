# üîê AI Agent System ‚Äì Security Guidelines (EN)

## üéØ Objective

To secure the AI Agent System across all layers of operation‚Äîensuring the privacy of customer data, preventing abuse of automation features, and safeguarding the platform from unauthorized or harmful actions.

---

## üß± Security Scope

Covers all architectural layers:

1. **Frontend (User Interface & Forms)**
2. **API Gateway & Backend Services**
3. **AI Agent Layer (LLM Planner / Tool Caller)**
4. **Tool Execution Services (Excel, Google Drive, Design Generator)**
5. **Secrets, Task Queues, Storage, and Logging**

## 1. üß© Frontend Security

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|------------|
| CSRF attacks | Use CSRF tokens for all form submissions |
| XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) | Sanitize and escape all user inputs before rendering |
| Malicious file uploads | Enforce MIME type and file size restrictions; validate extensions |
| Data leakage | Mask or omit sensitive data unless user is authenticated/authorized |
| Unauthorized admin access | Implement separate admin login with MFA and session timeout |

---

## 2. üß∞ API + Backend Security

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|------------|
| Unauthorized API access | Require JWT or API keys with proper scopes for sensitive endpoints |
| Untrusted input triggering backend jobs | Strong validation before pushing tasks to queue or calling tools |
| Internal error exposure | Catch and wrap errors with user-safe messages; avoid raw stacktraces |
| Brute-force or scraping | Rate-limiting via IP/user + CAPTCHA if needed |
| Admin command injection | Validate and sanitize all admin commands before processing |

---

## 3. üß† AI Agent Layer (LLM Planning)

| Risk | Protection |
|------|-------------|
| Prompt injection | Clearly separate user data from system prompts; sanitize strings |
| Arbitrary tool execution | Whitelist tools and apply `PlanValidator` middleware |
| Infinite loops in planning | Cap agent iterations (e.g., `MAX_ITER=10`) per session |
| Malicious commands embedded in prompts | Agent must ignore anything outside defined `Goal` scope |
| Role confusion | Strict separation between customer and admin agent contexts |

---

## 4. üîß Tool Execution Security

| Vulnerability | Defense |
|---------------|--------|
| Arbitrary file access | Sandbox all file operations to designated folders |
| Command injection | Parameterize all shell commands; avoid string concatenation |
| API credential exposure | Use short-lived tokens; rotate keys regularly |
| Excessive resource usage | Set timeouts and resource limits for all operations |
| Privilege escalation | Run tools with least privilege principle |

---

## 5. üîë Admin Command Security

| Risk | Protection |
|------|-------------|
| Unauthorized admin access | Require strong authentication with MFA for all admin operations |
| Command injection | Validate and sanitize all admin commands before processing |
| Privilege escalation | Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for admin operations |
| Sensitive data exposure | Encrypt all sensitive data in transit and at rest |
| Audit trail tampering | Implement immutable audit logging for all admin operations |

### Admin Authentication Requirements

- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all admin accounts
- Strong password policy with regular rotation
- IP-based access restrictions for admin operations
- Session timeout after period of inactivity
- Failed login attempt monitoring and lockout

### Admin Command Validation

- Whitelist of allowed command patterns
- Input sanitization to prevent injection attacks
- Parameter validation before execution
- Rate limiting for admin operations
- Command execution confirmation for destructive operations

### Admin Audit Logging

- Log all admin commands with timestamp, admin ID, and command details
- Log all command execution results
- Immutable audit trail for compliance and forensics
- Regular audit log review
- Alerting for suspicious admin activities

## 6. üìä Monitoring & Incident Response

| Component | Monitoring Strategy |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Authentication | Track failed logins, unusual access patterns, session anomalies |
| API endpoints | Monitor request volume, error rates, response times |
| Agent sessions | Track completion rates, error states, tool usage patterns |
| Resource usage | Monitor CPU, memory, API quotas, rate limits |
| Admin operations | Monitor all admin command executions and results |

---

## 7. üîÑ Compliance & Data Handling

| Requirement | Implementation |
|-------------|----------------|
| Data retention | Clear policy for how long order data, designs, logs are kept |
| User consent | Explicit terms for AI processing, data storage, third-party services |
| Access controls | Role-based permissions for viewing customer data |
| Data minimization | Only collect what's needed; anonymize where possible |
| Secure disposal | Proper deletion of data after retention period |

This security guideline document should be reviewed quarterly and updated as new threats or requirements emerge. All team members must be trained on these guidelines during onboarding.
